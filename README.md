## LLM Provider and API Key Configuration

To use AI-powered annotation generation, you can choose from multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure, MistralAI, Groq, Ollama, Google, and more).

### 1. Select the LLM Provider and Model

- Open the extension settings (File > Preferences > Settings or `Ctrl+,`).
- Set `annotation.provider` to your desired LLM provider (e.g., `openai`, `anthropic`, `mistralai`, etc.).
- Set `annotation.model` to the model you want to use for the selected provider (e.g., `gpt-4o-mini`, `claude-3-haiku`, etc.).

### 2. Enter Your API Key

- On the first AI request for a given provider, the extension will automatically prompt you for the corresponding API key in a secure dialog.
- You can also manually enter or update all your API keys in the settings, under the `llm.apiKeys` object (see above).
- Keys are securely stored using VS Code's Secret Storage.
- If you switch providers, the extension will prompt for the new provider's API key if it is not already set.
- You can update or reset any key at any time in the settings or via the dedicated command.

### 3. Usage

- Once the provider, model, and key are configured, use the **AI Suggest Annotation** command (`annotations.aiSuggest`) to generate an AI-powered annotation for the current line.
- You can change providers or models at any time in the settings; the relevant key will be requested if needed.

### Notes
- If no key is set for the selected provider, the extension will prompt you to enter it on first use.
- All keys can be managed in the settings for quick and centralized access.
- The multi-provider system lets you easily switch between LLMs and models according to your needs or quotas.

- **Annotation actions**: You can navigate to an annotation, edit it, delete it, or add comments directly from the Tree View.

### Activity Bar

The **Activity Bar** adds a dedicated icon for **Out-of-Code Insights** in the Visual Studio Code sidebar. Clicking this icon opens the Tree View of annotations.

- **Quick access**: The Activity Bar provides quick access to all annotations in your project.
- **Centralized management**: All annotations are centralized in a single view, making them easier to manage and navigate.

### Example Usage

1. **Open the Tree View**:
   - Click the **Out-of-Code Insights** icon in the Activity Bar.
   - The Tree View opens, displaying annotations grouped by file.

2. **Navigate to an annotation**:
   - Click on an annotation in the Tree View.
   - The code editor automatically positions itself on the line of the selected annotation.

3. **Edit or delete an annotation**:
   - Right-click on an annotation in the Tree View.
   - Select **Edit** or **Delete** from the context menu.

4. **Add a comment**:
   - Select an annotation in the Tree View.
