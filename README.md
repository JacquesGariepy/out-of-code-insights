- **Annotation storage**:
  - Annotations are stored in a JSON file named **`annotations.json`**, located by default in the **`.out-of-code-insights`** directory of your project.
  - **Include this file in your version control repository** if you want to preserve annotation history and share comments with your team.
- **OpenAI API Key Management**:
  - The extension uses your OpenAI API key for AI-powered features.
  - The key is securely stored using VS Code's Secret Storage, ensuring that your key is protected and only accessible by this extension.
  - **To remove or update your OpenAI API key**:
    1. **Open the Command Palette**:
       - Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac).
    2. **Type**: `Developer: Clear Extension Secret Storage`.

## LLM Provider and API Key Configuration

To use AI-powered annotation generation, you can choose from multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure, MistralAI, Groq, Ollama, Google, and more).

### 1. Select the LLM Provider and Model

- Open the extension settings (File > Preferences > Settings or `Ctrl+,`).
- Set `annotation.provider` to your desired LLM provider (e.g., `openai`, `anthropic`, `mistralai`, etc.).
- Set `annotation.model` to the model you want to use for the selected provider (e.g., `gpt-4o-mini`, `claude-3-haiku`, etc.).

### 2. Enter Your API Key

- On the first AI request for a given provider, the extension will automatically prompt you for the corresponding API key in a secure dialog.
- You can also manually enter or update all your API keys in the settings, under the `llm.apiKeys` object (see above).
- Keys are securely stored using VS Code's Secret Storage.
- If you switch providers, the extension will prompt for the new provider's API key if it is not already set.
- You can update or reset any key at any time in the settings or via the dedicated command.

### 3. Usage

- Once the provider, model, and key are configured, use the **AI Suggest Annotation** command (`annotations.aiSuggest`) to generate an AI-powered annotation for the current line.
- You can change providers or models at any time in the settings; the relevant key will be requested if needed.

### Notes
- If no key is set for the selected provider, the extension will prompt you to enter it on first use.
- All keys can be managed in the settings for quick and centralized access.
- The multi-provider system lets you easily switch between LLMs and models according to your needs or quotas.

## Tree View and Activity Bar

The **Out-of-Code Insights** extension includes a **Tree View** and an **Activity Bar** for efficient annotation management. Here is a detailed description of these features:

### Tree View

The **Tree View** allows you to visualize and manage annotations in a structured manner. It is accessible via the Activity Bar in Visual Studio Code.

- **Grouping by file**: Annotations are grouped by file, making navigation and management easier.
### Example Usage
- **Annotation display**: Each file contains a list of annotations with details such as the author, date, and annotation message.
- **Annotation actions**: You can navigate to an annotation, edit it, delete it, or add comments directly from the Tree View.

### Activity Bar

The **Activity Bar** adds a dedicated icon for **Out-of-Code Insights** in the Visual Studio Code sidebar. Clicking this icon opens the Tree View of annotations.

- **Quick access**: The Activity Bar provides quick access to all annotations in your project.
- **Centralized management**: All annotations are centralized in a single view, making them easier to manage and navigate.

### Example Usage

1. **Open the Tree View**:
   - Click the **Out-of-Code Insights** icon in the Activity Bar.
   - The Tree View opens, displaying annotations grouped by file.

2. **Navigate to an annotation**:
   - Click on an annotation in the Tree View.
   - The code editor automatically positions itself on the line of the selected annotation.

3. **Edit or delete an annotation**:
   - Right-click on an annotation in the Tree View.
   - Select **Edit** or **Delete** from the context menu.

4. **Add a comment**:
   - Select an annotation in the Tree View.
   - Click **Reply** to add a comment to the annotation.

These features enhance annotation management by providing an overview and management tools directly integrated into the Visual Studio Code interface.

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### "Annotations not showing in editor"
- **Check visibility**: Use `Ctrl+Alt+T` to toggle annotation display
- **Verify file path**: Ensure annotations.json is in the correct location (`.out-of-code-insights/` by default)
- **Restart VS Code**: Sometimes a restart is needed after installation

#### "Template variables not working"
- **Use correct syntax**: Variables should be `{{variableName}}` with double curly braces
- **Check template format**: Ensure template is properly saved and contains variables
- **Verify input**: Make sure you're entering values for all template variables

#### "Linked annotations not navigating correctly"
- **Check file paths**: Ensure linked files exist and paths are correct
- **Verify line numbers**: Line numbers should match the actual annotation location
- **Use relative paths**: For better portability, use relative paths when linking

#### "Kanban board not updating"
- **Refresh manually**: Use the refresh button in the Kanban board
- **Check column assignments**: Ensure annotations are assigned to valid columns
- **Restart extension**: Disable and re-enable the extension if needed

#### "Code snippets not applying"
- **Position correctly**: Ensure cursor is on the annotation line before applying
- **Check snippet syntax**: Variables should use `$1`, `$2`, `${1:placeholder}` format
- **Verify language**: Make sure the snippet language matches the target file

#### "Review Mode not starting"
- **Check filters**: Ensure filter settings aren't excluding all annotations
- **Verify annotations exist**: Make sure there are annotations to review
- **Reset filters**: Clear all filters and try again

#### "Performance issues with large projects"
- **Increase limits**: Adjust `annotation.maxAnnotationsPerFile` in settings
- **Use filters**: Filter annotations by file, author, or date to reduce load
- **Close unused features**: Close Kanban board and Review Mode when not needed

### Getting Help
- **Check settings**: Review all extension settings in VS Code preferences
- **Console logs**: Open Developer Tools (F12) to check for error messages
- **Extension page**: Visit the VS Code marketplace page for updates and known issues
- **Community support**: Use GitHub Discussions for questions and community help
